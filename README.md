# Notes App MVVM
The Notes App MVVM is an Android application developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, implemented with the Kotlin programming language. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with notes, stored locally on the device. The app also includes a search functionality that allows users to find notes based on priority.

## Key Features
  1. **MVVM Architecture:** The Notes App is built following the MVVM architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

  2. **CRUD Operations:** Users can perform essential CRUD operations on notes, including creating new notes, viewing existing notes, updating notes, and deleting notes. The app ensures smooth and reliable data management.

  3. **Local Storage:** All notes are stored locally on the device, ensuring offline accessibility and data persistence.

  4. **Search Functionality:** The app includes a search feature that allows users to search for notes based on their priority levels. This makes it easy to find specific notes quickly.
